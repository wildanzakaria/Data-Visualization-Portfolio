# Data-Visualization-Portfolio
This is my second mini portfolio about data visualization. Data visualization is one of the skills or techniques that must be possessed by a data analyst. By visualizing data, we can better understand a problem that occurs and also see the latest trends in business.<br/>
## Overview Dataset
This data contains shopping information for 10 different shopping malls between 2021 and 2023 in Istanbul. This data is disaggregated by different age and gender groups to provide a comprehensive view of shopping habits. This data includes important information such as the invoice numbers, customer IDs, age, gender, payment methods, product categories, quantity, price, order dates, and shopping mall locations. This data will be visualized using tools from Looker Studio and Google Sheets.
